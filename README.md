### Hi there, I'm Dave. ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm currently the founding engineer of a Health Tech startup in stealth mode ðŸ¤«   
I've served on a number of technical teams in a number of technical roles.
My work history can be found out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dashah/) if you're curious.

If you'd like to chat about anything tech related, feel free to snag some time on my calendar [here](https://daveshah.youcanbook.me/). This calendar isn't connected to my personal or work calendars, but feel free to block some time regardless. I'll be sure to follow up if there's a conflict!
